# üî• Introducing Next-Generation Flamegraph Visualization for Node.js

Today we're excited to announce a revolutionary new approach to CPU profiling and flamegraph visualization in Node.js. We've built a complete profiling ecosystem that spans from individual applications to enterprise microservice architectures, with beautiful visualization that makes performance optimization intuitive and actionable.

## A Complete Profiling Ecosystem

Our comprehensive solution consists of three powerful components working together:

- **`@platformatic/flame`**: Universal profiling toolkit for any Node.js application
- **`react-pprof`**: WebGL-powered visualization components and standalone HTML generation
- **[Watt](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/watt/overview) Integration**: Built-in profiling for the Node.js Application Serveri with service-level granularity

Together, these tools provide everything you need for Node.js performance analysis, from development to production.

### üî• `@platformatic/flame`: Universal Node.js Profiling

Our profiling toolkit is designed from the ground up for integration into any Node.js application or development workflow:

- **Zero-Config Profiling**: Drop-in profiling for any Node.js script with no code changes required
- **Integration-First Design**: Built specifically to integrate into existing applications, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools
- **Signal-Based Control**: Start/stop profiling using `SIGUSR2` signals - perfect for production environments
- **Programmatic API**: Rich JavaScript API designed for tooling integration and automation
- **Cross-Platform CLI**: Simple commands that work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Standard Output Format**: Generates industry-standard pprof files compatible with the entire ecosystem

```bash
# Integrate profiling into any Node.js application (auto-start mode)
flame run server.js
# ... application runs with profiling active ...
# Stop the app (Ctrl-C) to automatically save profile and generate flamegraph

# Manual profiling mode for CI/CD and automated testing
flame run --manual server.js
# In another terminal, send SIGUSR2 signal to toggle profiling:
kill -USR2 <PID>  # Start profiling
# ... run your tests or load scenarios ...
kill -USR2 <PID>  # Stop profiling and save profile
# Stop the server (Ctrl-C) to automatically generate flamegraph
```

### üé® `react-pprof`: WebGL-Powered Visualization

Our React component library brings professional-grade flamegraph rendering to the web:

- **WebGL-Accelerated Performance**: Smooth, responsive rendering even with massive profile datasets

- **Rich Stack Details**: Complete call hierarchy visualization with parent/child relationships
- **Customizable Theming**: Multiple color schemes and full styling control
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) integration with comprehensive type definitions
- **Static HTML Generation**: Generate standalone HTML flamegraphs with our CLI tool

```tsx
import { FlameGraph, StackDetails, fetchProfile } from 'react-pprof'

function ProfileViewer() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null)
  const [selectedFrame, setSelectedFrame] = useState(null)
  
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', height: '100vh' }}>
      <FlameGraph 
        profile={profile}
        onFrameClick={(frame, stack, children) => {
          setSelectedFrame(frame)
        }}
        zoomOnScroll={true}
      />
      <StackDetails selectedFrame={selectedFrame} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### üèóÔ∏è Watt: Enterprise Application Server Integration

[Watt](https://docs.platformatic.dev/docs/watt/overview), Platformatic's Node.js application server, provides built-in profiling capabilities designed for microservice architectures:

- **Service-Level Profiling**: Profile individual microservices or entire applications with granular control

- **Remote Profiling**: Profile services running in any environment
- **Automatic Discovery**: Auto-detects running services and provides simple commands

```bash
# Start profiling all services in your Watt application
wattpm pprof start

# Or target specific services
wattpm pprof start api-service database-service

# Generate load, then stop profiling
wattpm pprof stop
# Automatically saves pprof files for each service

# Generate interactive flamegraphs with flame
flame generate pprof-api-service-*.pb
flame generate pprof-database-service-*.pb
```

## What is a Flamegraph?

A flamegraph is a powerful visualization technique that shows exactly where your Node.js application spends its CPU time. Think of it as an X-ray for your code's performance.

### How to Read a Flamegraph

- **Width = Time**: Wider sections represent functions that consumed more CPU time
- **Height = Call Depth**: Taller stacks show deeper function call chains  
- **Colors = Heat**: Warmer colors (reds/oranges) indicate functions using more CPU at their stack level
- **Click to Zoom**: Interactive exploration lets you drill down into specific code paths

**What to Look For:**
- **Wide Plateaus**: Functions consuming significant CPU time - prime optimization candidates
- **Tall Spires**: Deep call stacks that may indicate complex or recursive logic
- **Multiple Peaks**: Different execution phases or code paths in your application
- **Dominant Sections**: The largest areas show where most CPU time is spent

Flamegraphs turn complex performance data into an intuitive visual map, making it easy to spot bottlenecks and understand your application's behavior at a glance.

## The Complete Workflow

Here's how easy it is to profile your Node.js applications:

### 1. Install the Tools
```bash
npm install -g @platformatic/flame
npm install react-pprof  # For React integration
```

**Package Links:**
- [`@platformatic/flame`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@platformatic/flame) on npm
- [`react-pprof`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pprof) on npm

### 2. Profile Your Application
```bash
# Profile any existing Node.js app (profiling starts immediately)
flame run your-app.js

# In another terminal, generate some load while profiling is active
curl http://localhost:3000/api/heavy-computation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/heavy-computation

# Stop the app (Ctrl-C) to automatically save profile and generate HTML flamegraph
# You'll see the exact file paths and browser URL in the output:
# üî• CPU profile written to: cpu-profile-2025-08-28T12-00-00-000Z.pb
# üî• Flamegraph generated: cpu-profile-2025-08-28T12-00-00-000Z.html
# üî• Open file:///path/to/cpu-profile-2025-08-28T12-00-00-000Z.html in your browser
```

### 3. View the Results
```bash
# The HTML flamegraph is automatically generated - just open it!
open cpu-profile-*.html

# Or generate from existing pprof files
flame generate cpu-profile-*.pb
```

## Built on Open Source Foundation

Our profiling ecosystem builds upon excellent prior work in the Node.js performance analysis space. We're particularly inspired by [`0x`](https://github.com/davidmarkclements/0x), the pioneering flamegraph tool for Node.js created by David Mark Clements, which introduced many developers to the power of flamegraph visualization. The success of 0x later led to [Clinic.js](https://clinicjs.org/), a comprehensive performance toolkit created by NearForm and built on top of 0x's foundation.

While these tools provided valuable inspiration, our approach represents a novel direction: combining modern web technologies with integration-first design to create a unified ecosystem that spans from individual development to enterprise microservice architectures.

Our toolkit is powered by Datadog's generous open source contribution: the [`@datadog/pprof`](https://github.com/DataDog/pprof-nodejs) library. This battle-tested Node.js profiling library provides the core CPU sampling and pprof data export functionality that makes our entire toolkit possible.

We're grateful to both the 0x project for pioneering Node.js flamegraph analysis and to Datadog for open sourcing this critical infrastructure, which together enable the Node.js community to have access to production-grade profiling capabilities that were previously only available in enterprise monitoring solutions.
