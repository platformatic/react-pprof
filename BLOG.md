# üî• Introducing Next-Generation Flamegraph Visualization for Node.js

Today we're excited to announce a revolutionary new approach to CPU profiling and flamegraph visualization in Node.js. At the heart of this ecosystem is `@platformatic/flame` - a profiling toolkit built specifically for seamless integration into any Node.js application or development workflow. Paired with `react-pprof` for stunning WebGL-powered visualization, these packages deliver an unparalleled developer experience.

## The Power of Two: `@platformatic/flame` and `react-pprof`

We've developed a comprehensive profiling ecosystem that combines the best of both worlds: powerful data capture with stunning visualization.

### üî• `@platformatic/flame`: Built for Seamless Integration

Our profiling toolkit is designed from the ground up for integration into any Node.js application or development workflow:

- **Zero-Config Profiling**: Drop-in profiling for any Node.js script with no code changes required
- **Integration-First Design**: Built specifically to integrate into existing applications, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools
- **Signal-Based Control**: Start/stop profiling using `SIGUSR2` signals - perfect for production environments
- **Programmatic API**: Rich JavaScript API designed for tooling integration and automation
- **Cross-Platform CLI**: Simple commands that work consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Standard Output Format**: Generates industry-standard pprof files compatible with the entire ecosystem

```bash
# Integrate profiling into any Node.js application
flame run server.js

# Perfect for CI/CD and automated testing
flame toggle  # Start profiling
# ... run your tests or load scenarios ...
flame toggle  # Stop and save profile

# Programmatic integration in your tools
const { startProfiling } = require('@platformatic/flame')
const { pid, toggleProfiler } = startProfiling('app.js')
```

### üé® `react-pprof`: WebGL-Powered Visualization

Our React component library brings professional-grade flamegraph rendering to the web:

- **WebGL-Accelerated Performance**: Smooth, responsive rendering even with massive profile datasets
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click, zoom, and navigate through your performance data with fluid animations  
- **Rich Stack Details**: Complete call hierarchy visualization with parent/child relationships
- **Customizable Theming**: Multiple color schemes and full styling control
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) integration with comprehensive type definitions
- **Static HTML Generation**: Generate standalone HTML flamegraphs with our CLI tool

```tsx
import { FlameGraph, StackDetails, fetchProfile } from 'react-pprof'

function ProfileViewer() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null)
  const [selectedFrame, setSelectedFrame] = useState(null)
  
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', height: '100vh' }}>
      <FlameGraph 
        profile={profile}
        onFrameClick={(frame, stack, children) => {
          setSelectedFrame(frame)
        }}
        zoomOnScroll={true}
      />
      <StackDetails selectedFrame={selectedFrame} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## The Complete Workflow

Here's how easy it is to profile your Node.js applications:

### 1. Install the Tools
```bash
npm install -g @platformatic/flame
npm install react-pprof  # For React integration
```

**Package Links:**
- [`@platformatic/flame`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@platformatic/flame) on npm
- [`react-pprof`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pprof) on npm

### 2. Profile Your Application
```bash
# Profile any existing Node.js app
flame run your-app.js

# In another terminal, generate some load
curl http://localhost:3000/api/heavy-computation

# Toggle profiling to capture the workload
flame toggle
# ... make more requests ...
flame toggle  # Stop profiling
```

### 3. Visualize the Results
```bash
# Generate interactive HTML flamegraph
flame generate cpu-profile-*.pb
open cpu-profile-*.html
```

## Built on Open Source Foundation

Our profiling ecosystem is powered by Datadog's generous open source contribution: the [`@datadog/pprof`](https://github.com/DataDog/pprof-nodejs) library. This battle-tested Node.js profiling library provides the core CPU sampling and pprof data export functionality that makes our entire toolkit possible.

We're grateful to Datadog for open sourcing this critical piece of infrastructure, which enables the Node.js community to have access to production-grade profiling capabilities that were previously only available in enterprise monitoring solutions.

## Technical Excellence

Both packages are built with production-grade quality in mind:

### `react-pprof` Features:
- **WebGL Rendering Pipeline**: Custom shaders for optimal performance
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility Support**: Full keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance  
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Pixel-perfect consistency across updates
- **Storybook Integration**: Comprehensive component documentation with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

### `@platformatic/flame` Features:
- **Integration-First Architecture**: Designed for seamless embedding in existing applications and tools
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works consistently across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments
- **Protocol Buffer Output**: Standard pprof format for compatibility with entire profiling ecosystem
- **Automatic Compression**: Efficient gzipped profile storage for CI/CD and automation
- **Process Management**: Clean signal handling perfect for production and development workflows
- **API-Driven Design**: Rich programmatic interface for building custom profiling solutions

## Real-World Performance

We've tested both tools extensively:

- **Large Profiles**: Handles profiles with 100k+ frames smoothly
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized data structures and WebGL resource management
- **Fast Startup**: Sub-second initialization for most profiles
- **Responsive Interaction**: 60fps zooming and panning even on mobile devices

## Integration Examples

### [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) Application
```javascript
// No code changes needed!
// server.js remains exactly the same
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/heavy', (req, res) => {
  // Your existing CPU-intensive code
  const result = performComplexCalculation()
  res.json(result)
})

app.listen(3000)
```

```bash
# Profile the Express app
flame run server.js

# Generate load and capture profile
flame toggle
curl http://localhost:3000/heavy
flame toggle

# Visualize results  
flame generate cpu-profile-*.pb
```

### [React](https://reactjs.org/) Application Integration
```tsx
import { FlameGraph, StackDetails } from 'react-pprof'

function ProfileDashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="profiling-dashboard">
      <FlameGraph 
        profile={profile}
        primaryColor="#3498db"
        secondaryColor="#87ceeb" 
        backgroundColor="#2c3e50"
        onFrameClick={handleFrameSelection}
      />
      <StackDetails 
        selectedFrame={selectedFrame}
        stackTrace={stackTrace}
        children={children}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## What Makes This Special

Unlike traditional profiling tools, our approach combines:

1. **Integration-First Design**: `@platformatic/flame` is built to integrate seamlessly into any existing Node.js application, CI/CD pipeline, or development tool
2. **Modern Web Technology**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) components with [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) acceleration
3. **Zero-Config Experience**: Drop-in profiling with no code changes required  
4. **Production Ready**: Battle-tested performance and reliability in real-world applications
5. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Standard pprof output works with the entire profiling toolchain
6. **Beautiful Visualization**: Professional-grade flamegraphs that actually help you understand your code
